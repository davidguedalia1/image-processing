Question 2:
The blending with small values of filter image we will not get such a good blend.
i.e the blend looks like two pictures together.
Because building the laplacian pyramid causes resizeing the picture and when the blur
is not well we losing information so after building the laplacian pyramid and
blending two images together we get no smooth transition because of the lose of information.

But Blending with big image filters make the image to be smeared and not accurate.
distorted and smeared meaning the edges between both images looks smeared  and not exact.
This happends because when we have a big image filter, blurring a pixel with lots pixels
that are far from the pixel, so blending the two images together with a large filter
we loosing the masking process of it because we blur the image with
pixels that not suit.
