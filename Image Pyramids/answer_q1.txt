Question 1:
We multiplying every level by a coefficient to control image result, as we can see
every level as a ring pass filter, because it has certain range of frequencies.
As the higher the pyramid layer so it has lower the frequency range.
To multiply the lower levels by higher values on the top's pyramid so the outlines will be much clearer.
But if we multiplying with smaller coefficients we get blurrier picture.
