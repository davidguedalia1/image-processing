Question 3:
blending two images when their pyramid levels are low looks like two images reflect together.
it happends because when the pyramid levels are low we get two pictures that have high outlines
so trying blend the two pictures together we get trouble between the two pictures.

When we blend two images when their pyramid levels are high it looks like smeared in the edges between the two images.
Because when we make the pyramid longer we get pictures that are very blurred so we lost the image.
After we build the blended image we use levels that are blurred so we got
the final image to be blurred.
