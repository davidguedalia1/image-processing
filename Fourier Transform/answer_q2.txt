Question 2:
The difference between the functions:
The two of the files we got a speed up of the original,
At the resize_spectogram function we get a faster but dirty sound and it is because
there is "waves" on top. When we compare for a shorter time and we don't correct the phases of the waves so they cancel
the other.
When we used phase_vocoder we get a clean sound because of the correction of the phases
where waves will not cancel the other.
