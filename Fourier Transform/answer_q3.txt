Question 3:
The difference between the magnitudes is the result of - calculating using convolution
we saw match explicit lines representing from using fourier transform.
Because convolution is linear and continuous and fourier transform is discrete.
When we use fourier transform we lost some information and get less explicit lines in the magnitude.
The both are close to the real derivative, from the results I think the convolution method is more accurate.
