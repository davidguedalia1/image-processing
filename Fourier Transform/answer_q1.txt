Question 1:
The difference between them is:
in change_rate i saw there is higher frequencies, because multiplying the rate, so the frequencies of the
waves get bigger so the duration is speed, On the other hand, in change samples we are converting be fourier signal
and remove the high frequencies. so we got a speed up without high frequencies.
